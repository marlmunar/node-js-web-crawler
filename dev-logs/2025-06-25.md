# Dev Log â€” 2025-06-25

## What I Worked On

- Learned about test-driven development
- Learned a bit about Jest

## What I Learned

- There is usually three steps in doing test-driven development:
  1. Stub out the function to test.
  2. Write the test for the function.
  3. Finalize the function.
- Jest automatically looks for files with the .test.js extension.
