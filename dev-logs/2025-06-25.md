# Dev Log â€” 2025-06-25

## What I Worked On

- Learned about test-driven development
- Learned a bit about Jest
- Normalizing a URL

## What I Learned

- There is usually three steps in doing test-driven development:
  1. Stub out the function to test.
  2. Write the test for the function.
  3. Finalize the function.
- Jest automatically looks for files with the .test.js extension.
- Created a test using Jest.
- For this project, normalizing a URL must be done to ensure that the app works with
  consistent data. I learned that it is commonly done following a pattern:
  - Remove the protocol from the URL.
