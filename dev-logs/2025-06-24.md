## What I Worked On

- Learned about HTTP Headers
- Learned about the Headers API
- Learned about the use of X-API-Key
- Reviewed the .json() method
- Reviewed the JSON.stringigy() and JSON.parse()
- Learned about XML

## What I Learned

- HTTP Headers are simply what hold additional information that clients and
  servers passed with each request and response. They are key-value pairs that
  pass metadata about the request or response.
- Headers API allows the users to perform various actions on the http headers.
  These actions include retreiveing, setting and removing a header value.
- With the right configuration with the app's backend, X-API-Key metadata
  can be used for user authentication.
- .json method is a function that can be used to the response object which
  returns its JSON data after it is parsed as a JS object.
- JSON.stringify() is the method used to parse a JS object to a JSON data.
  JSON.parse() acts similarly with .json method in a way that is parses JSON
  to a JS object, but it only accepts string that is a valid JSON as input.
- Learned about an alternative to JSON called XML. It is referred to as
  Extensible Markup Language which is structuted like HTML, it is like JSON
  but in a different syntax. Instead of key-value pairs, it wraps data into
  XML tags.
