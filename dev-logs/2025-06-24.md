- Learned about HTTP Headers
- Learned about the Headers API

## What I Learned

- HTTP Headers are simply what hold additional information that clients and
  servers passed with each request and response. They are key-value pairs that
  pass metadata about the request or response.
- Headers API allows the users to perform various actions on the http headers.
  These actions include retreiveing, setting and removing a header value.
