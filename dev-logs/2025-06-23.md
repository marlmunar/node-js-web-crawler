## What I Worked On

- Learning about the JS URL API
- Learning about ICANN
- Got familiarized with the concept of subdomains
- Learned about URIs vs URLs

## What I Learned

- I learned that JS has an API for parsing URL string into an object.
  It is used to easily read the components of the URL of make changes to them.
  For documentation, refer to this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL

- I learned that there is this non-profit-organization that handles the internet's global
  addressing system. It is called ICANN or Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
  It keeps the DNS system up and running, making sure that IP addresses and domain names
  are unique and globally consistent.

- A domain name can have subdomains. Subdomains are generally used to organize and separate
  different parts of a website or service using a prefixed value to the domain name.
  Subdomains give flexibility to separate content, functionality, infrastructure, teams, or
  audiences — without needing a whole new domain name.

- URIs are referred to as Universal Resource Identifiers, and are used to idenitfy resources
  that are mostly accessed via the internet. URLs or Universal Resource Links on the otherhand
  are a type of URI that is used specifically for internet links. All URLs are URIs.
